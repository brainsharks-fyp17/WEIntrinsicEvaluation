First we preprocess Common Crawl Dataset to remove numbers, short sentences and special characters. This repo also includes code to remove stop words.

Then we train three types of word embedding models;
  1) Word2Vec
  2) Glove
  3) FastText
  
  Preprocessed Data can be found via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lb4-eAr1rpFFGg_rk_djPCCVYiOpY6Hi?usp=sharing

Also, this repo contains source code and datasets to two types of intrinsic evalaution;
  1) Analogy Evaluation
  2) Relatedness Evaluation
